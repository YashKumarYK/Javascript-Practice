**Javascript Basics and practice**

**Types**  
1. Primitive types -> Numbers, Booleans, String, NULL, Undefined, Symbol
2. Reference Types -> functions, array, objects

**Difference between Primitive and Reference type:**  
_Primitive types are copied by their values and reference types are copied by their address/references._

**OBJECT CLONING:** The object cloning is a way to create exact copy of an object.  
There are three ways to clone the object.
1. Iteration
2. Assign
3. Spread
